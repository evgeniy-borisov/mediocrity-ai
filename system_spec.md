# System Specification

## Project Title

**Autonomous Self-Improving Scientific Research System with Agent-Based Evolutionary Architecture**

---

## 1. Project Goal

Create an AI system that:
- Generates hypotheses
- Conducts experiments
- Analyzes and visualizes results
- Writes scientific papers
- Self-modifies its code
- Evolves through empirical testing
- Learns continuously and cumulatively

---

## 2. System Architecture

### Core Components

- **Idea Agent** – Hypothesis generation using LLMs and literature search
- **Experiment Manager** – Controls research flow: prototype → tuning → ablation
- **Experiment Tree** – Parallel branches of agent strategies and outputs
- **VLM Agent** – Vision-Language model for interpreting graphs/plots
- **Code Generator Agent** – Writes Python modules, tests, debugs
- **Darwin Gödel Agent (DGA)** – Self-improving agent that:
  - Analyzes and rewrites its own code
  - Runs benchmark tests (e.g., SWE-bench, Polyglot)
  - Logs evolution paths (mutation → test → survival)
  - Avoids hallucinations, bugs, and metric gaming
- **Integrations** – APIs: OpenAI, GitHub, Semantic Scholar, etc.
- **Evolution Log Storage** – Tree of all versions, logs, rollbacks, metrics

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Self-Improvement
- Detect flaws in own codebase
- Generate and test alternatives
- Preserve only validated versions
- Log change history as an evolution tree

### 3.2 Evolution
- Perform mutations on code/strategy
- Create multiple agent branches
- Rank and select by multi-objective fitness

### 3.3 Safety & Control
- Run experiments in sandbox
- Log every mutation and result
- Rollback capability
- Avoid objective hacking or deceptive optimization

### 3.4 Output
- Markdown, PDF, Jupyter reports
- AI-generated tag for publishing

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- Docker + Kubernetes for deployment
- GPU support for LLM/VLM processing
- Scalable: 100+ concurrent experiments
- Version control & reproducibility (e.g., Git-style checkpoints)

---

## 5. Integrations

- `OpenAI API`, `Claude API` – LLMs
- `Hugging Face Datasets`
- `Semantic Scholar` – Literature
- `GitHub API` – Codebase interaction
- `SWE-bench`, `Polyglot` – Code testing and evaluation

---

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

- Performance gains on SWE-bench/Polyglot
- Successful self-improvement ratio
- Avg. iterations to reach stable version
- Transferability of improvements
- Detected and fixed hallucinations/bugs

---

## 7. Development Stages

1. AI Scientist + DGA prototype
2. Agent architecture + evolution tree
3. Benchmark experiments
4. Safety/rollback/inspection tools
5. Report generation and publication tooling

---

## 8. Future Expansion

- Train foundation models through self-improvement
- Advance agent introspection/self-critique
- Offer as SaaS Research Copilot
- Apply outside code (e.g., bio, med, physics)
